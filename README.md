# eikon

_Eikon_ is a playful exploration in how the physical interfaces of games can be objects of and vehicles for contemplation. Players place their hands on a simple-looking board that can sense the degree of force applied at certain points. By slowly moving their fingers, exploring the contours of the interface, and applying varying degrees of pressure, they are presented with an ever-changing array of abstract minimalist visuals and a complex ambient soundscape. The entire experience echoes the ritualistic aspects of ceremonial objects (prayer candles, tea ceremonies, stained-glass, mandalas, idols, etc) and how they can be used to point out to something larger about the external world.
