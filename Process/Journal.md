## 10.01.25 | Why?

This project is a quick turn-around idea for the [2025 Whaaat!? Festival](https://whaaat.io) that is situated in the [playthings](https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/planetVelocityMap/blob/main/Proposal/README.md#playthings) section of the thesis work. The core goal here is to explore how the physical interfaces of games can be objects of and vehicles for contemplation. I am thinking specifically of objects of worship and/or ceremonial objects (prayer candles, stained-glass, mandalas, icons[^1], idols, etc) and how they point out to something beyond them, but while this concept can be easily understood from a spiritual context, I think there is also something to be explored about the use of objects for non-spiritual contemplative ends (Japanese tea ceremony being a clear precedent)

Within play then, can objects create a state of contemplation in the player? It's worth being reminded that the working definition for contemplation is the one taken from Djebbara et al where it is a "heightened level of awareness and an intentional focus on the present moment, fostering a state of deep reflection and non-judgmental engagement." This seems fairly reasonable, right? Are players being 'contemplative' when they are intensely focused on their games? I think maybe (?), but for this project I would like to focus on the transference of focus from the object to the external world. 

So, some design goals:
- A physical interface that does not read "game interface"
- Ambiguous visuals and sounds. I don't want the player to feel as they have 'solved' anything
- Extended time - instead it's more about how long they have spent with the object, learning from the micro-movements

## 10.05.25 | Ideation

This image in the top left corner is getting closest to what I am envisioning for this project. I like some of these other ideas as well, but I think the hidden force-sensor grid on a board (with some sort of thick overlay to dissipate the force) allows for some serious ambiguity and therefore time spent with the thing. Additionally, the idea of it being on a board reads a little [prie-dieu](https://churchantiques.com/product/excellent-quality-1910-carved-gothic-oak-small-prie-dieu-from-st-saviours-sunbury-sale/) which I like. 

I think eventually, I would really like this on top of some sort of box, or behind a display area of some sort so that there is a third article that becomes the exact _object_ of contemplation. The experience could change based on what is placed there. Essentially some sort of contemplative [amiibo](https://www.nintendo.com/us/amiibo/) situation.[^2]

First steps:
- Knock up a version that takes in keyboard inputs. I can switch this over to the controller once I build it in Colorado
- Order the components and ship them to Boulder
- Think about the sound/visuals. I have no idea what these will be, and this could easily veer off into screen-saver territory, so I'll have to be a little careful there
