the habit of perceiving reality
attraction and surprise
increasingly intangible
cloudlike
ghostly 
linger on information
relevant only fleetingly
information does not illuminate
pursue information
gain no knowledge
take notice of everything
gain no insight
travel across the world
having no experience
communicate incessantly
don't participate in community
collect vast quantities of data
don't following up on recollections
accumulate friends and followers
don't meet an other
a machine does not free the hand from work
an informaton
we prefer experiencing to possessing
we prefer being to having
the more I experience, the more I am 
fate has no place in the digital order 
without bodily touch, no ties can emerge 
the time of things is past 
through swiping, I submit the world to my needs 
the truly beautiful cannot be touched
it demands distance
