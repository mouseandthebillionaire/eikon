We are now in the habit of perceiving reality in terms of attraction and surprise.
The world is becoming increasingly intangible, cloudlike and ghostly 
It is not possible to linger on information. It is relevant only fleetingly.
Information by itself does not illuminate the world
Today, we pursue information without gaining knowledge
We take notice of everything without gaining any insight
We travel across the world without having an experience
We communicate incessantly without participating in community
We collect vast quantities of data without following up on our recollections
We accumulate friends and followers without meeting an other
A machine does not free the hand from work, but an informaton does
We prefer experiencing to possessing being to having
The more I experience, the more I am 
Fate has no place in the digital order 
Without bodily touch, no ties can emerge 
The time of things is past 
Through all my swiping, I submit the world to my needs 
The truly beautiful cannot be touched. It demands distance
